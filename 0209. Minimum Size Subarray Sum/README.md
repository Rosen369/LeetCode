# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of __n__ positive integers and a positive integer __s__, find the minimal length of a __contiguous__ subarray of which the sum â‰¥ __s__. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

__Example:__

```
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
