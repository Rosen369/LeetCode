# Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given a __complete__ binary tree, count the number of nodes.

__Note:__

__Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):__
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

__Example:__

```
Input:

   / \
