# Divide Two Integers

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
```

__Note:__

- Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
- The divisor will never be 0.
- Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 2<sup>31</sup> − 1 when the division result overflows.
