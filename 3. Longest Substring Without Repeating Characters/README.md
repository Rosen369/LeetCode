# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the __longest substring__ without repeating characters.

__Example:__

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a __substring__, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.
