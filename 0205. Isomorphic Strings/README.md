# Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings __s__ and __t__, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in __s__ can be replaced to get __t__.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

__Note:__
You may assume both __s__ and __t__ have the same length.
