# Product of Array Except Self

Given an array `nums` of n integers where n > 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

__Example:__

```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

__Note:__ Please solve it __without division__ and in O(n).

Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array __does not__ count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
