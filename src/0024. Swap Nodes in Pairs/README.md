# Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

__Example:__

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

__Note:__

- Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
- You may __not__ modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
