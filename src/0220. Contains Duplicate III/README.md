Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the __absolute__ difference between __nums[i]__ and __nums[j]__ is at most t and the __absolute__ difference between i and j is at most k.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```
