# 4Sum II

Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples `(i, j, k, l)` there are such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -2^28 to 2^28 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 2^31 - 1.

__Example:__

```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```
