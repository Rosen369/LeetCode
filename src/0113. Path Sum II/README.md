# Path Sum II

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

__Note:__ A leaf is a node with no children.

__Example:__

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```pseudo
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
```

Return:

```pseudo
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```
