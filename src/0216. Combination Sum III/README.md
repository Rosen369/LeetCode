# Combination Sum III

Find all possible combinations of __k__ numbers that add up to a number __n__, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

__Note:__

- All numbers will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

__Example 1:__

```pseudo
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
```

__Example 2:__

```pseudo
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
```
