# Palindrome Pairs

Given a list of **unique** words, find all pairs of **distinct** indices `(i, j)` in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. `words[i] + words[j]` is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

```pseudo
Input: ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
```

**Example 2:**

```pseudo
Input: ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
```
