# Majority Element II

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

__Note:__ The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

__Example 1:__

```pseudo
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

__Example 2:__

```pseudo
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
