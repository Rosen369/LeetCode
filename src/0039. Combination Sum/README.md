# Combination Sum

Given a __set__ of candidate numbers (`candidates`) __(without duplicates)__ and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sums to `target`.

The __same__ repeated number may be chosen from `candidates` unlimited number of times.

__Note:__

- All numbers (including `target`) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

__Example 1:__

```pseudo
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```

__Example 2:__

```pseudo
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```
