# Ugly Number

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are __positive numbers__ whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`.

__Example 1:__

```pseudo
Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

__Example 2:__

```pseudo
Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```

__Example 3:__

```pseudo
Input: 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
```

__Note:__

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1].
