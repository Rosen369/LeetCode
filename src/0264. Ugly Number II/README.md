# Ugly Number II

Write a program to find the `n-th` ugly number.

Ugly numbers are __positive numbers__ whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`.

__Example:__

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

__Note:__

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. `n` __does not exceed 1690__.
