# Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

```pseudo
Input: 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Integer 11 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011
```

**Example 2:**

```pseudo
Input: 128
Output: 1
Explanation: Integer 128 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000010000000
```
