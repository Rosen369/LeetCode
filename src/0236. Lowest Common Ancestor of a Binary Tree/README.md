# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow __a node to be a descendant of itself__).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\]

```pseudo
        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
```

__Example 1:__

```pseudo
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

__Example 2:__

```pseudo
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself
             according to the LCA definition.
```

__Note:__

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
