# Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, [twoâ€™s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.

__Note:__

1. All letters in hexadecimal `(a-f)` must be in lowercase.
2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4. You __must not use any method provided by the library__ which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

__Example 1:__

```
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
```
