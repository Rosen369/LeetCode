# Add Binary

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both **non-empty** and contains only characters `1` or `0`.

**Example 1:**

```pseudo
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

**Example 2:**

```pseudo
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```
