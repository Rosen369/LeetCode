# Arranging Coins

You have a total of _n_ coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every _k_-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of __full__ staircase rows that can be formed.

_n_ is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

__Example 1:__

```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

__Example 2:__

```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```
