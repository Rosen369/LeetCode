# Find All Duplicates in an Array

Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a\[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear __twice__ and others appear __once__.

Find all the elements that appear __twice__ in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

__Example:__

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```
