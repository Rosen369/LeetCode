# Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**

```pseudo
Input:
"bbbab"

Output:
4

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

**Example 2:**

```pseudo
Input:

"cbbd"
Output:
2
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```
