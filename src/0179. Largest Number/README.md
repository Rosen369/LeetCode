# Largest Number

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

__Example 1:__

```pseudo
Input: [10,2]
Output: "210"
```

__Example 2:__

```pseudo
Input: [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

__Note:__ The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
