# Count of Range Sum

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.
Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (`i` â‰¤ `j`), inclusive.

__Note:__

A naive algorithm of O(n^2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

__Example:__

```pseudo
Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Output: 3
Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
```
