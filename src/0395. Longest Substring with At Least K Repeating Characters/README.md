# Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

Find the length of the longest substring __T__ of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in __T__ appears no less than _k_ times.

__Example 1:__

```
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```
